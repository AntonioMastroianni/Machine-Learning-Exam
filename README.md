## About

This project investigates the factors that contribute to successful goal-scoring in football using association analysis on a large dataset of football match events. By analyzing variables such as player positions, shot locations, assist methods, and situations during matches, we aim to uncover hidden patterns — the so-called "magic formula" — that lead to goals.
The study leverages event-level data from top European leagues and applies data mining techniques like association rule mining and logistic regression to reveal the most influential combinations of play characteristics.
The insights derived can help coaches, analysts, and strategists optimize team formations, player roles, and tactical decisions to enhance goal-scoring efficiency and overall team performance.
